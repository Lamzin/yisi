usage: ../src/cmdlp/build/bin/cmdlp_test -[-b]eta --reference_file_prefix|--refs file_0 (... file_n)

     This can be a pretty long text about what the program does, that
     goes between the usage and the option descriptions. Just to give
     you an idea, I am going to ramble on for a while; although I really
     don't have that much to say.
       Oh, and paragraphs should work to, so any newline will be
     interpreted as a paragraph break. Neat, huh? (Keep in mind that C++
     transforms newlines when reading to and from fstreams, so it should
     be a control-n regardless of which platform you're on.)

-[-a]lpha|--ALPHA=10
     The alpha value.
-[-b]eta=0
     The beta value.
-[-f]lip=no
     A switch
--on=no
     Turns on
--off=yes
     Turns off
-[-s]tr=
     Some input strings
--cipher=
     Encrypts the provided strings.
-[-c]onst="pi":3.14
     Named numeric constants.
-[-m]agic=no_magic
     [no_magic] Disable magic completely. [less_magic] Limit magic to keep them
     guessing. [more_magic] Make no mistake, magic is here!
--settings=/dev/fd/63
     A settings file.
--reference_file_prefix|--refs=test_ref.en
     A prefix for reference files.
--dumpto=
     Dumps the parameters, as undestood by the program, to a config file that
     can later be used to rerun with the same settings. Leave empty to not dump.
     Use '-' to dump to standard output.
--config=
     Read parameters from the provided file as if they were provided in the same
     position on the command line.
-[-h]elp=yes
     Prints the help message and exits normally.

     Again, lay out the text if you will! Maybe add some credits (or
     copyright if you're not into the whole copyleft thing).
